              The Days Grimm is arguably Indiana's most comical, thrilling, and controversial podcast. This three-pronged mandate acts as a primary filter for our guest selection.
            </p>
            <p className="text-text-secondary mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              The <strong className="text-primary">"comical"</strong> aspect is reflected in our official genre of "COMEDY INTERVIEWS" and our history of hosting local stand-up comedians. The <strong className="text-primary">"thrilling"</strong> component is evident in interviews with individuals who have extraordinary life stories, such as people who survived shootings, rare medical conditions, and combat.
            </p>
            <p className="text-text-secondary mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Finally, the <strong className="text-primary">"controversial"</strong> element is demonstrated by Brian & Thomas' willingness to engage in difficult or unfiltered conversations, touching on topics like homelessness, artificial intelligence, and religious hypotheticals.
            </p>
            <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
              Our brand is not built on polished narratives but on the authentic, often messy, intersection of hardship and humor. The most compelling guests are those who have navigated a "Grimm" reality and emerged with a story to tell, and ideally, a sense of humor about it. This dynamic is the core of our appeal and the primary filter for identifying a story worth telling.
